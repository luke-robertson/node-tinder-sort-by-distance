`Sort Tinder Matches`

You need to get your X-Auth-Token to use this

You can do that by logging into your tinder web app, opening dev tools, find the token on the header for /matches

webapp:  https://tinder.com/app/recs


data get saved to `results/${country}_${city}.json`

Its slow as you have to ping each profile manualy to get their location
